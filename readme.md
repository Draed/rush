**What is a rush ?**
<!-- <blockquote>  -->
A rush is a working session limited in time by a countdown. It is like a challenge about accomplishing a list of task in a certain duration (3/6/12/24 hours challenge). Each rush is managed by my [Rush app](https://github.com/Draed/rush_app), which help me working in good condition, but also generate a report about my work.
